**Continuous Analysis Computer Vision 2**

Welcome to Continuous Analysis Computer Vision, a Python script that transforms your camera into a real-time image recognition and metal substance detection tool. This application provides a dynamic and interactive experience, capturing frames from the default camera and analyzing the surroundings seamlessly.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed before running the script:

"pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy"

**Usage**

Run the script continuous_analysis.py.
The script will open the default camera and start the continuous analysis.
Image recognition results and metal substance detection are displayed in real-time.
Press the 'q' key to exit the program.

**Features**

Real-time Image Recognition: Utilizes the MobileNetV2 model for continuous image recognition.
Metal Substance Detection: Applies edge detection to highlight potential metal substances in the live camera preview.
Age Calculation: Prompts for the person's birthdate and calculates the age in days.

**Notes**

Make sure your camera is properly connected and accessible.
Press the 'q' key to exit the program.
Feel free to customize and extend the script according to your specific project details and requirements. Enjoy exploring the possibilities with Continuous Analysis Computer Vision!
